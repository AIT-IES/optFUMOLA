MATSuMoTo is the MATLAB Surrogate Model Toolbox for solving
   -computationally expensive
   -black-box
   -global
optimization problems, where variables may be
   -all continuous
   -all integer
   -some continuous and others integer.

MATSuMoTo gives the user the choice between
   -various initial experimental design strategies
   -surrogate models and surrogate model mixtures
   -sampling strategies

Please see the code manual for installation and usage of the toolbox.
